Hello, This is a READ ME FILE, I(Zaid) created using vim in Git Bash

The instructions for running the program is that you need to...

 1. Execute the program in Dev C++(preferably)
 2. When the output shows in the console modify the console if the output format is not proper.
 3. The program will show the output in a millisecond by millisecond basis until the program completes it execution(voluntarily). To continue running the program after each second press Enter, or if you want to stop after a particular second else press ; and then press Enter.
